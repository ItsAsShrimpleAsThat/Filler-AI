Hi! If you are coming from my video and want to use the engine it is not too hard. You first have to have python on your computer, I also use some packages that you will have to install those being
pygame, pygame_widgets, and anytree. If you need help on this just look up installing packages using pip. 

How to use!
Run the main file code
  You should get a generated board *if not that is probably because it failed to generate the board which is a bug I do not care to fix. Just rerun again until you get it.*
You can use the number keys on your keyboard or press the buttons, you should be fighting the ai at a depth of 10. *If you want to change the depth of the AI there is a constant at the top of
                                                                                                                    the main.py file, change the constant that says DEPTH*
The AI does not tend to care about finishing the game once it has declared that it has won in every possible state, this does not really matter since you can just realize it has won and restart.

To enter the edit mode press e and use the arrow keys to change the colors (press 1-6 to set the color of the selected square)
